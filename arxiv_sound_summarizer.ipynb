The complex underwater\\nenvironments, unpredictable transmission channels, and dynamic motion states\\ngreatly impact the real-world underwater acoustic signals, and may even obscure\\nthe intrinsic characteristics related to targets. Consequently, the data\\ndistribution of underwater acoustic signals exhibits high intra-class\\ndiversity, thereby compromising the accuracy and robustness of recognition\\nsystems.To address these issues, this work proposes a convolution-based mixture\\nof experts (CMoE) that recognizes underwater targets in a fine-grained manner.\\nThe proposed technique introduces multiple expert layers as independent\\nlearners, along with a routing layer that determines the assignment of experts\\naccording to the characteristics of inputs. This design allows the model to\\nutilize independent parameter spaces, facilitating the learning of complex\\nunderwater signals with high intra-class diversity. Furthermore, this work\\noptimizes the CMoE structure by balancing regularization and an optional\\nresidual module. To validate the efficacy of our proposed techniques, we\\nconducted detailed experiments and visualization analyses on three underwater\\nacoustic databases across several acoustic features. The experimental results\\ndemonstrate that our CMoE consistently achieves significant performance\\nimprovements, delivering superior recognition accuracy when compared to\\nexisting advanced methods.', 'author': [{'name': 'Yuan Xie'}, {'name': 'Jiawei Ren'}, {'name': 'Ji Xu'}], 'arxiv:doi': {'@xmlns:arxiv': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', '#text': '10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123431'}, 'link': [{'@title': 'doi', '@href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2024.123431', '@rel': 'related'}, {'@href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11919v1', '@rel': 'alternate', '@type': 'text/html'}, {'@title': 'pdf', '@href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11919v1', '@rel': 'related', '@type': 'application/pdf'}], 'arxiv:journal_ref': {'@xmlns:arxiv': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', '#text': 'Expert Systems with Applications (2024): 123431'}, 'arxiv:primary_category': {'@xmlns:arxiv': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', '@term': 'cs.SD', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}, 'category': [{'@term': 'cs.SD', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}, {'@term': 'eess.AS', '@scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}]}, {'id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11748v1', 'updated': '2024-02-19T00:21:13Z', 'published': '2024-02-19T00:21:13Z', 'title': 'Low-power SNN-based audio source localisation using a Hilbert Transform\\n  spike encoding scheme', 'summary': 'Sound source localisation is used in many consumer electronics devices, to\\nhelp isolate audio from individual speakers and to reject noise. Localization\\nis frequently accomplished by \"beamforming\" algorithms, which combine\\nmicrophone audio streams to improve received signal power from particular\\nincident source directions. Beamforming algorithms generally use knowledge of\\nthe frequency components of the audio source, along with the known microphone\\narray geometry, to analytically phase-shift microphone streams before combining\\nthem. A dense set of band-pass filters is often used to obtain known-frequency\\n\"narrowband\" components from wide-band audio streams.
