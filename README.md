# Arxiv Sound Summary

Lil project for summarizing the latest sound-related papers on Arxiv.

## Repo

- The .py file is the script to run 
- The .ipynb is more of an experimental notebook to try things out / play around

## Instructions

TBD! Try running it, and if you have any issues, just install whatever libraries are needed :P
